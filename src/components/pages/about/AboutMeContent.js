            Hello, Iâ€™m Justin, a third year computer science student at the 
            <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html"> University of Alberta </a>  
            
            <br></br> <br></br>
            Outside of computers, I like to run (when it isn't -30) and play hockey 
            and soccer. I enjoy reading, although if I'm in school my 
            book completion rate falls enormously.
